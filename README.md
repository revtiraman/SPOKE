# 🎙️ Spoke
### *"You spoke. It shipped."*

**Record a 60-second video about a business problem. Spoke builds you a working autonomous AI agent. Automatically. No code required.**

---

## ⚡ The 2-Minute Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spoke
cd spoke
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_cli.py
```

Watch 8 AI agents design, write, test, and fix their own code in real time. No credentials needed.

## 🧠 What Is Spoke?

Spoke is an **8-agent autonomous pipeline** that converts a spoken problem description into a deployed AI agent.

A founder records 60 seconds: *"I waste 2 hours every day copying order emails into my spreadsheet."*

Ten minutes later, a working agent is live — reading real emails, extracting order data, updating a real spreadsheet. Nobody helped it. Nobody coded it. **It built itself.**

## 🔁 The 8-Agent Pipeline

```
[VIDEO INPUT]
      ↓
[AGENT 1: TRANSCRIBER]    whisper-large-v3      → speech to text
      ↓
[AGENT 2: ANALYST]        Kimi-K2-Instruct      → problem graph extraction
      ↓
[AGENT 3: CLARIFIER]      Llama-3.3-70B         → 2 targeted follow-up questions
      ↓
[AGENT 4: ARCHITECT]      DeepSeek-R1           → complete solution blueprint
      ↓
[AGENT 5: CODER]          Qwen3-Coder-30B       → production Python code
      ↓
[AGENT 6: EXECUTOR]       sandbox               → runs the code
      ↓
[AGENT 7: DEBUGGER]       Qwen3-Coder-30B       → reads errors, fixes code, retries
      ↓
[AGENT 8: DEPLOYER]       Llama-3.3-70B         → packages + report
      ↓
[LIVE WORKING AGENT]
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — One command (recommended)
```bash
./run.sh demo
```

### Option 2 — Manual
```bash
# Install
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure (optional — demo works without credentials)
cp .env.example .env
# Add your HF_API_TOKEN for full pipeline

# Run the UI
streamlit run frontend/app.py

# Or run CLI demo
python demo_cli.py

# Or run a specific transcript
python demo_cli.py --transcript "I spend 3 hours updating CRM records from customer emails"
```

### Option 3 — Full stack with API
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload &
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## 🤖 Models Used

| Agent | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Transcriber | `openai/whisper-large-v3` | Best open-source speech recognition |
| Analyst | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct` | Long context, deep reasoning |
| Clarifier | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` | Fast, free tier |
| Architect | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` | Best planning and reasoning |
| Coder | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` | Best open-source coder |
| Debugger | `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct` | Same coder for consistency |
| Deployer | `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` | Fast report generation |

## ⚙️ Configuration

```bash
# .env
HF_API_TOKEN=hf_your_token         # Required for full pipeline
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=optional         # Optional premium brain
SANDBOX_TYPE=subprocess            # subprocess | e2b | docker
MAX_DEBUG_RETRIES=5                # Self-healing retry limit
DEMO_MODE=false                    # true = skip all API calls
```
